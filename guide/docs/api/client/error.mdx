:::note
Error handling is a bit different in Rust. Look at each returned `Result<T>` types
returned for a better understanding.

## Param error

When sending a request, the request might fail immediately with a `ParamError`
exception. This means that one of the parameter is invalid and generally indicates
that there is a programming error. Examples are `NULL` parameters or invalid
address.

## Error info

In every response callback, there is a `ErrorInfo` structure that contains information
about the status of the request. The most important field to look at is `summary`.
It has three main values:

- If it is `STATUS_OK`, it means the request was successful and if data was
  requested, it will be present and valid.
- If it is `STATUS_EXCEPTION`, it means the server returned a Modbus exception.
  The `exception` field will contain the actual exception code returned. Also,
  the `raw_exception` field will contain the raw value. This can be useful if
  the `exception` value is `UNKNOWN`.
- If it is anything else, it means something else prevented the client to obtain
  a proper response (e.g. unable to establish a connection, timeout occured,
  malformed response, etc.). Look at the `Status` enum documentation for more
  details.

Here is an example of error handling:

<Tabs
groupId="language"
defaultValue="Rust"
values={[
{label: 'Rust', value: 'Rust'},
{label: 'C', value: 'C'},
{label: 'Java', value: 'Java'},
{label: 'C#', value: 'C#'},
]}>
<TabItem value="Rust">

```rust
{{#include ../rodbus/examples/client.rs:error_handling}}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="C">

```c
{{#include ../ffi/bindings/c/client_example.c:error_handling}}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Java">

```java
{{#include ../ffi/bindings/java/examples/src/main/java/io/stepfunc/rodbus/examples/ClientExample.java:error_handling}}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="C#">

```csharp
{{#include ../ffi/bindings/dotnet/examples/client/Program.cs:error_handling}}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
