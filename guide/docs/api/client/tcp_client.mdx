A `Channel` presents the same interface once you create it, regardless of the underlying transport.
You can create a TCP client channel using `create_tcp_client` method.

:::note
In Rust, you can use the `spawn_tcp_client_task` to create a channel and spawn the runner task in the current runtime.
Otherwise, you can use `create_handle_and_task` and manually spawn the returned future when ready.

## Maximum queued request

Each channel sends one request at a time and has a fixed-length buffer of requests to send. If the queue is full when demanding
a request, this call **will block** until the queue has enough space.

## Endpoint configuration

The endpoint may contain endpoints consisting of a `<host>:<port>` tuple where "host" is one of the following:

* IPv4 address
* IPv6 address
* DNS name

## Retry strategy

A channel tries to establish and maintain a connection as soon as it is created. To avoid flooding, reconnection
delays are introduced.

The `RetryStrategy` controls the rate at which the client retries failed connection attempts. The client uses exponential backoff when attempting to establish
a connection. The delay between attempts doubles from `min_delay` up to `max_delay`.

## Decode level

See [logging configuration page](../logging.mdx#protocol-decoding) for more details.
