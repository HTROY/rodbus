This library supports serial communication using the RTU transmission mode. It features an addressing
scheme similar to the TCP transmission mode, as well as a checksum to ensure integrity of the messages.
A multi-drop scenario can be implemented by having a single client communicating with multiple servers
sharing the same serial link. A broadcast mechanism is also available to send write requests
simultaneously to all servers.

## Special addresses

### Broadcast

When a write request is received with the broadcast unit ID (`0x00`), it is automatically forwarded to all registered
handlers. Note that no response will be sent back.

### Reserved addresses

Addresses 248 (`0xF8`) to 255 (`0xFF`) inclusively are reserved in the specification and **should not be used**. The library does not
enforce this, but a warning message will be printed.

## Creating a server

To create a RTU server, first build a `DeviceMap` for each unit ID that the server will answer, similarly to how it's done for [TCP server](./tcp_server).
Then use the `create_rtu_server` static method of the `Server` class. The created server will start listening on the serial port immediately.

The `create_rtu_server` function takes the following arguments:

- `runtime`: tokio runtime used to drive the async process. See [Runtime](../runtime.mdx) for more details.
- `path`: path of the serial device.
  - On Windows, it's generally something like `COM3`
  - On Linux, it's generally something like `/dev/ttyS3`. You need to have the adequate permissions
    to access these devices.
- `serial_port_settings`: structure with various serial port settings:
  - Baud rate in bit per second
  - Data bits. Note that Modbus should use 8 data bits.
  - Stop bits
  - Parity
  - Flow control
